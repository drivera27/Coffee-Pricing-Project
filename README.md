The dataset consisted of 5 tables, including product details, information on customers, and orders placed from 2023-2025.
Files including the original data and modifications made can be found [here](https://github.com/drivera27/Coffee-Pricing-Project/tree/b58762adf190c7f360547d256b55b54e9fe3ed19/data).
The SQL queries used to pull from these tables can be found [here](https://github.com/drivera27/Coffee-Pricing-Project/blob/b58762adf190c7f360547d256b55b54e9fe3ed19/coffee_query.sql).


## Executive Summary
### Overview
* Change in revenue, profit
* I identified six products that had significantly low profit margins:

  * Pour-Over Starter Kit
  * Branded Ceramic Mug
  * Gooseneck Electric Kettle
  * Logo Hoodie (Black)
  * Chemex Filters (100 pack)
  * Minimalist Keychain
  
Most of these are merchandise products, which only made up for **7% of 2025's total revenue**; the lowest of any product category. Many of these have had historically low profit margins, but rising costs resulted in even more diminishing returns this year. 
### Recommendations
* **Raise prices for several products:**
* **Discontinue *Logo Hoodie (Black)*:** Orders are down 35% from 2023, and have held consistently weak margins - as low as 12% as of 2025. Due to weak sales and rising costs, it may be best to discontinue this product.
